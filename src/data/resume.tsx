    "I'm a Senior Software Engineer with **6+ years** of experience building and scaling web products — from multi-tenant SaaS and learning platforms to e-commerce, fintech and restaurant POS systems.\n\nI work across the whole stack: **Laravel** and **NestJS** on the backend, **Vue.js**, **React** and **Next.js** on the frontend, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** underneath, shipped with Docker, CI/CD pipelines and AWS.\n\nI care most about software that holds up in production — secure payment flows, fast checkouts, POS systems that keep selling when the network drops, and architecture the next engineer can extend without fear. I enjoy turning fuzzy requirements into clean, modular systems, working closely with product and design to get there.",
